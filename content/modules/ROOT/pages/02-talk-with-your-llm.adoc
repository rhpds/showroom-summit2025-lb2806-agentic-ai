= 2. Interacting with Your LLM using Python

In this short module, our primary goal is to verify that we can successfully run simple Python applications that communicate with our running Large Language Model (LLM). Recall from Module 1 that we are using `ollama` (which internally uses `llamacpp`) as our LLM runtime.

This module also marks a transition: from this point forward, all technical instructions, code examples, and detailed explanations for the lab exercises will be presented within Jupyter Notebooks.

Take a few moments to familiarize yourself with the JupyterLab interface. JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment. We'll be using Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) within it. Notebooks are documents that can contain both runnable Python code (in "code cells") and explanatory text, images, and links (in "markdown cells"). This format is excellent for learning and experimentation.

Please switch your focus to the "JupyterLab" tab, typically located to the right in your lab interface. You can adjust the width of this panel by dragging the divider if you need more space. Once in the JupyterLab tab, locate and open the notebook for this module: `02-talk-to-your-llm.ipynb`. All further instructions for this section will be found inside that notebook.

[TIP]
====
The JupyterLab interface is quite flexible. It supports drag-and-drop, allowing you to rearrange tabs (like terminals and notebooks) to create a workspace that best suits your preferences. Feel free to experiment with the layout.
