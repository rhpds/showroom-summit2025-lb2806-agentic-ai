= 2. Talk with your LLM

In this module we will simply verify hat we can run simple Python applications that to our LLM runtime (`ollama/llma-cpp`) and model.

From this module onwards, the entire technical content of the lab, and explations, will be embedded in the Jupiter Lab notebooks

Take a few moments to explore the Jupyter interface and get comfortable with it.

In Jupyter Lab, you can create and run code cells, which are blocks of code that can be executed independently. You can also create markdown cells for documentation and explanations.

[TIP]
====
The Jupyter Lab UI supports drag and drop so you can create an interface to suit your style of working and drag terminals and notebooks around to suit your style.

// Jupyter notebooks are interactive computing environments that enable users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Originally developed for Python as part of Project Jupyter, these notebooks have become essential tools for data scientists, researchers, and educators due to their ability to combine executable code with rich text elements in a single document. Jupyter notebooks facilitate an iterative workflow where users can run code cells individually, immediately see the results, and make adjustments based on those outcomes—making them ideal for data exploration, analysis, and presentation. Their web-based interface allows for easy sharing and collaboration, while support for multiple programming languages (including Python, R, and Julia) has contributed to their widespread adoption across scientific computing, machine learning, and educational contexts.

Originally developed for Python as part of Project Jupyter, these notebooks have become essential tools for data scientists, researchers, and educators due to their ability to combine executable code with rich text elements in a single document. The core concepts include: cells (code cells for executing programming statements and markdown cells for documentation), kernels (computational engines that execute the code), non-linear execution flow (allowing cells to be run in any order), rich output display (supporting visualizations, tables, and interactive widgets), and persistent state (maintaining variables between executions).
